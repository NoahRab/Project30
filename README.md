This project was created for my web development class in 2020, it is a mock CounterStrike marketplace website, intended on showing my understanding with html, css, bootstrap, and javascript. This project includes a home page showing the name of the website with a picture to give you a sneak peak of what you can find in the marketplace, the second page is an overview of the website on this page the company would explain what the website is all about and what you can do on it. Next is a page that describes some of the cool features you can expect on the website. The following page is encouraging you to register so you can enter in giveaways and use the site to shop. This site also includes a register button where you can create an account with an email and password.
